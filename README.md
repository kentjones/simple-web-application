 The Logback architecture is comprised of three classes  
 - Logger: Is a context for logging messages
 - Appender: Places messages in their final destination (i.e. console, file) 
 - Layout: How the message should look in the console or file.

Run `Gradle assemble` to create a war artifact. Deploy to tomcat and you are golden.
